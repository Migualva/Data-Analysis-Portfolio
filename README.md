Hello! I'm Miguel and this is my Data Analysis portfolio. This overview only provides brief descriptions of each project. For a comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to explore each project individually for more detailed insights. Thank you for reading!

## Portfolio Projects
## [Proyect 1: Students Perfromance in Exams](https://github.com/Migualva/Students-Performance-in-Exams)

**Code:**  [students-performance-in-exams.ipynb](https://github.com/Migualva/Students-Performance-in-Exams/blob/main/students-performance-in-exams.ipynb) 

**Raw data:** [StudentsPerformance.csv](https://github.com/Migualva/Students-Performance-in-Exams/blob/main/StudentsPerformance.csv)

**Description:** Beginning with a dataset that contains comprehensive information about students' performance on three exams, each covering different subjects. The aim of this analysis is to understand how students' grades can be improved by examining factors such as parental level of education or participation in a test preparation course. An introduction initiates the analysis, followed by data preparation, as some columns become handy being different data types with no loss of information on the process. Subsequently, data visualization techniques are employed to illustrate distributions, including boxplots, pie diagrams, and barplots. Some examples:

Finally, after a thorough analysis of all factors involved, the project ends with a correlation analysis and conclusions.

## [Proyect 2: Student Stress Factors: A Comprehensive Analysis](https://github.com/Migualva/Student-Stress-Factors-A-Comprehensive-Analysis)

**Code:**  [student-stress-factors-a-comprehensive-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/Migualva/Student-Stress-Factors-A-Comprehensive-Analysis/blob/main/student-stress-factors-a-comprehensive-analysis.ipynb)

**Raw data:** [StressLevelDataset.csv](https://github.com/Migualva/Student-Stress-Factors-A-Comprehensive-Analysis/blob/main/StressLevelDataset.csv)

**Description:** This dataset contains 20 features, selected scientifically considering 5 major factors -  Psychological, Physiological, Social, Environmental, and Academic Factors. The goal of this project is to reveal how each one influences the student. Understanding its impact can be meaningful to identify key areas for interventions and psychological support. First, simple questions by the dataset creator are answered, visually on some degrees, to help showcase the differences on each feature. Some examples:

However, as the project develops, the focus moves onto the 5 major factors, rather than only the 20 features. Therefore, questions become harder, as now we have to consider each feature, inside each factor, trying to understand which is more important or which has the higher impact on anxiety levels. In order to do this, scikit is the desired tool.

After all of this, conclusions are drawn from results obtained on this analysis.
